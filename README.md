# Building a RESTful API and Angular App.

The goal of this book is document everything I learned while building a RESTful API that is consumed by an Angular frontend. This application is by no means a fully functioning app and is intended solely to be a learning tool for understanding how to build an app using the MEAN stack.

*The repos used to build this application can be found here:*
* [API - Backend*](https://github.com/slugbyte/slugram-backend)
* [Angular - Frontend](https://github.com/jonathanheemstra/28-angular_auth)


_*Note: I did not build the slugram backend. I built a backend with similar functionality but for the sake of this resource I am going to use and reference the fully built out slugram backend._

## Technologies Used:
| *Backend* | *Frontend* |
|---|---|
| MonogoDB | Angular |
| Express | SCSS |
| Node | Babel |
| Mongoose | Webpack |
| AWS | Jasmine |
| Chai/Mocha | Karma |
